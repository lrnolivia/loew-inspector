# Latest decisions and cleanup receipt

Updated October 3, 2026, 05:09 UTC. These decisions override earlier drafts where they conflict.

## Field appearance and shared casing
The user selected this naming direction for the actual existing palette:
- teal: aqua teal
- sienna: sienna solstice
- gold: gold halo
- green: flora green
- coral: terra coral
- monochrome: monochrome
- neutrachrome: lunar chrome

Names are spaced and lowercase; monochrome is one word. Keep monochrome and lunar chrome adjacent. Preserve stable theme IDs, aliases and saved preferences; these are display names, not a destructive migration.

Appearance popover: compact chrome preview at the top, showing sample UI text and the accent name; labeled light/dark switch beneath; clickable swatch row below. Hover or keyboard focus previews color and name without committing. Click/tap selects and persists. Touch has a usable equivalent. Earlier alternative cards/separators were abandoned.

Shared loew design standard: built-in interface chrome and copy use lowercase in branded mode, including buttons, settings labels, brand and theme names. Preserve the user's own page/project names and authored content exactly. Font names inside font previews can retain normal casing; underlying identifiers remain unchanged. Inspect and honor the existing branded/off option if present; do not force lowercase over an opt-out or invent a setting before inspection. This casing audit applies to Field and related ctrl/Relay built-in UI.

## Canonical cleanup mutations completed
- ctrl review-delivery claim is held; draft code and local recovery preserved.
- rtxForge held claim amended with complete handoff link; Julian implementation stopped, including icon integration.
- Relay MCP queued continuation amended with original and latest handoff; user starts Mac Codex, receiver identity still pending.
- Field appearance queue amended; obsolete hold-before-PR138-release instruction removed because PR138 already shipped.
- Ten old queued-only Relay assignments were superseded into the existing MCP continuation, not marked delivered. Full original goal/acceptance remains in original-records/relay.json.
- Documentation and recovery artifacts are in Relay PR138, branch relay/execution-handoffs-20261003. No production deployment.

## Remaining cleanup boundaries
- 41 queue rows still say claimed although matching claims are completed. Their exact pairs are preserved. Current engine offers no safe normalization action; the MCP handoff includes the required narrow CAS-guarded fix. Do not bypass guards or restart them as work.
- The queued desktop-card-parity record remains unchanged after ownership safety review blocked retirement. User approval was requested for supersession into the existing MCP continuation. Preserve its native-client proof requirements regardless of record status.
- Four expired reservations require writer/provenance accounting before retirement: Relay production smoke, Relay minimal probe, Field mobile focus, loewOS bootstrap. Expiry is not authority to take over.
- Actual receiving Codex owner IDs are not known. Documents/code are accessible now; administrative claim/handoff follows when the receiving sessions identify themselves.

## Plugin account cleanup
The user explicitly wants obsolete personal-created entries removed except current Relay App ID asdk_app_6abe234861d881919e30db65d656492f, Version ID asdk_app_v_6abe234861e481919f6452cfb12d250f.
Seven obsolete records remain. The authorized loew Inspector workaround was attempted: both old Inspector entries expose Open in desktop app rather than an Install action; installed-plugin search finds neither, so no Delete control was reachable. Creator tools expose no delete action; uninstall is not deletion of a creation record. No entry was removed and the current Relay remains untouched. Do not claim success or repeatedly retry unsupported routes.

## Additional Field requests at 05:10 UTC
- Main/popup menu items need meaningful glyphs from Field's established animated family, consistent size/alignment and accessible labels. Confirm the actual main popup surface before implementation.
- Find the canonical Field logo in Figma and create matching variants for the actual new accent palette, preserving existing geometry, materials, highlights and family consistency. Inspect current master/variants before recoloring. Use exact theme tokens, editable component/vector exports, and the shared discoverable asset manifest. This is additional variants, not a logo redesign. Source master is not yet positively identified. Design implementation remains paused until cleanup is complete.
