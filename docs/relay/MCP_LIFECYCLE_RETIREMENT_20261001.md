# Relay MCP rebuild: lifecycle prerequisite evidence

## Identity and boundary

- Persistent lead/owner: `01a0f914-aad0-71e4-8f0c-20c1bf0a2016`; staff Ellis.
- Canonical assignment: `relay-mcp-rebuild-20261001`.
- Branch: `relay/mcp-lifecycle-retirement-20261001`.
- Admitted baseline: `80abcd05325155ec42e0c7582bb82b1001e3634a`.
- Admission record: `d5ba1f3c4e29ee0c757f6d59339371616460cb15`; control commit `ff6a6071557592fd91e5c6c2c99af985e6aaec9c`.
- Preflight passed before implementation at 2026-10-01 20:24 UTC for all 19 admitted paths and four resources. Heartbeat verified at 20:34 UTC, record `91e4d25d3829f4ac352201a444f1a3a7b9bdcfee`. Publication preflight passed again at 20:38 UTC with that record; unrelated historical inventory findings do not block this assignment.
- Separate clone; the active Julian website checkout and its edits were not touched. No probe/card/auth/release-configuration source changed. Build generated only ignored local test inputs.
- Astra High was requested in delegation; actual model/effort is not independently exposed by this executor.

This draft implements only the lifecycle prerequisite. No merge, production deployment, live cancellation/supersession, old PR closure, or branch deletion is authorized or performed. PR92 and PR96 are historical evidence; neither branch nor code was adopted. The 51-capability MCP program and the clean real-host proof remain future bounded stages under this same lead.

## Why this batch exists

The existing coordination engine reserves every claim except `completed`, including held and expired work. Completion requires a real merged PR and durable work accounting. Marking abandoned experiments completed would falsely claim delivery; simply dropping them would erase ownership/history. This batch adds explicit retirement without either behavior.

The transaction preserves original work and intent, requires current owner and record/head evidence, stores a stable operation receipt, and releases only reservations. Supersession requires a distinct extant nonterminal successor. A lost response can be reconciled with refreshed CAS and the same operation id without writing again. There is no restore operation. Branch-head reads and record CAS are not one atomic GitHub transaction: writers must be quiescent and unpublished work accounted for by the caller.

MCP, CLI and workflow retirement share one validator/adapter. The progress queue view still lists only pending queued work; retired queue-only records remain visible through assignments and terminal resume checkpoints. Retired claims have explicit terminal observed-progress states. Canonical source, runtime mirror and Git blob pin are synchronized. The existing sync helper pointed to the wrong adapter file after the core split; it now targets the actual core pin and supports explicit local-candidate synchronization. Completion proof and cleanup eligibility are unchanged. Retired branches cannot be automatically deleted or reused.

## Validation

- `npm ci`: passed; 84 packages, zero reported vulnerabilities.
- `npm run build`: passed, including workspace syntax checks.
- Targeted lifecycle/transport/status/cleanup suite: 71 passed, zero failures.
- Full `npm test`: passed all 300 tests (213 Inspector/source/browser, 54 Runner, 3 layout, 17 contracts, 13 web); zero failures or skips.
- `npm run typecheck:2.0 --workspace @relay/web`: passed.
- Local runtime: Node 26.8.1; CI uses Node 22 and remains a separate required check.
- Test-generated web screenshots were moved out of the implementation checkout into task evidence; no website files are included in the diff.
- Additional resume-route integration: passed (11 resume tests total), confirming retired queue-only visibility and no duplicate claim/queue mirror checkpoint. Added after the full 300-test run.
- Mocked CLI subprocess tests execute the real validator and adapter, proving stale CAS/head rejection, permission-vs-absence handling, engine drift rejection, one write on uncertainty, exact readback reconciliation, and zero-write replay. They do not call production.
- Engine provenance regression checks canonical source bytes equal the mirror and the Git blob SHA equals the runtime pin.
- Cleanup tests assert both retired dispositions are retained even when completion-like evidence is present. Existing merged-completion tests remain intact.

Full regression attempts exposed a changed completion error message and a shortened tool-discovery dependency description; both implementations were repaired to preserve existing contracts. The sandbox also prevented local Chromium from launching (`bootstrap_check_in` permission denied). The suite was rerun with approved local test execution outside that sandbox; no expectations were weakened or skipped. These browser tests exercise existing local UI contracts, not real ChatGPT client support.

## Preserved research and next proof

The exact report `libfile_1aecf8ccbe1881918aa2f5b81a2681a8`, version1, was materialized consumer-locally and read completely: 122105 bytes, SHA-256 `b513cf397660d05116d2bcce0165ed998372ce3815b8f934caeb1e39dafe648b`. Historical report blockers were not treated as current authority.

Fresh bootstrap observed Relay 1.9.9 with 51 tools. The current bridge is handwritten; a standards-first resource URI/MIME and UI handshake remains a hypothesis to test, not an established root cause. A static card shell and script parse exist in source. A modal points at a v2 control-center resource while the current resource is v4; that is a navigation discrepancy, not evidence explaining a missing initial mount. Existing Inspector/Momo/feature-mark art and state meaning remain untouched.

No exact-build native client matrix has been proved in this batch:

| Client | Evidence | Remaining need |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ChatGPT desktop | Native app access was denied by computer-use safety control; no alternate control path attempted | Authorized actual-client access or a narrowly specified human check |
| ChatGPT web | Not exercised against a new registered probe build | Same app/tool/build control comparison |
| iPhone | Historical PR evidence only | Human device check of that same build |

Local Chromium/iframe/mobile-viewport tests cannot substitute for this matrix. App identity/install path, client versions and conversation modes still need exact capture. After this prerequisite is reviewed and separately released, request the next bounded claim scope for a clean, read-only visible card shell with unique resource/build identity; prove HTML, script, initialization, result delivery, dimensions and one read-only action separately, retaining text output. Any temporary host connection/deployment must first specify destination, auth/access and rollback to Julian. No paid backend, new credentials, DNS changes, endpoint replacement or manual production-upload workaround is authorized.


## First publication and canonical admission blocker

Draft PR [108](https://github.com/lrnolivia/relay/pull/108) initially published at `cc764a101ccbf93eebc3bb90deb4df08858603f3`. Its [canonical-main admission run](https://github.com/lrnolivia/relay/actions/runs/36923261816/job/110574246148) failed before policy evaluation with `spawnSync gh ENOBUFS`: the 769161-byte coordination record becomes more than the default 1 MiB child-process buffer once base64-encoded by GitHub Contents. This is transport capacity, not an owner conflict, browser capacity or permission error. The workflow deliberately checks out main, so a candidate-only repair cannot clear that check.

The admitted CLI now uses an explicit bounded 8 MiB response buffer. A real subprocess regression retires synthetic work while preserving an 820000-byte retained-history field whose encoded response exceeds 1 MiB. No live record is modified by that test. This repair stays within the declared transport files. The canonical check remains a release blocker until an independently authorized canonical fix is present; no workflow gate was weakened, no failing check rerun blindly, and no merge performed. Julian must coordinate that prerequisite and then rerun the existing exact-head admission check. The separate live MCP preflight has passed the same assignment/scope.
